# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how Deceptgold handles information when you run the software.

## Summary

Deceptgold does not send data to Deceptgold-operated servers by default.

When you configure integrations (such as Telegram notifications, webhooks, Slack, or Discord), Deceptgold will transmit the event data required to deliver those notifications to the destinations you configured.

## What data may be transmitted

Depending on your configuration and the events generated by your deployment, Deceptgold may transmit:

- Security event details and log messages
- Service identifiers and configuration context (e.g., which simulated service was targeted)
- Network information related to events (e.g., source IP address, destination port)
- System identifiers you configured or that are necessary for operation (e.g., hostname)
- Wallet address information if you configure blockchain-related features

## Where the data is sent

Deceptgold may send data to:

- Telegram (via the bot token/chat you configure)
- Any webhook endpoints you provide
- Slack/Discord endpoints you provide (if configured)

These endpoints are controlled by you or by the third-party service you choose.

## Purpose of processing

Deceptgold transmits data only for the purpose of:

- Delivering alerts/notifications you requested
- Providing operational visibility into honeypot events

## Data retention

Deceptgold does not operate a central collection service for your telemetry.

Retention depends on:

- Your local logging configuration
- The retention policies of the third-party services/endpoints you configured

## Your responsibilities

You are responsible for:

- Ensuring you have the legal basis to collect and process the data captured by your deployment
- Informing your users/administrators as required by applicable law
- Securing any third-party endpoints you configure

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated over time. The version in the repository is the current version.
