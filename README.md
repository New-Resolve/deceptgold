# Deceptgold - Cyber Deception and Resource Inversion 

Deceptgold is a next-generation platform designed to manage deception strategies and reclaim value from cyber attacks. While most organizations focus only on detection, logging, and mitigation, Deceptgold takes a radically different approach: it transforms the computational effort of intrusion attempts into valuable digital assets.

In today’s threat landscape, companies suffer not only from data breaches but also from a massive waste of computational power during attacks. Countless CPU cycles, network bandwidth, and system resources are consumed by malicious actors — and traditionally, all this energy is simply lost.

## Deceptgold solves this problem.

By deploying deceptive environments that interact with attackers in a controlled and intelligent way, the system is able to capture and redirect the power of attacks, converting what would otherwise be waste into tangible assets for the defending organization. This turns an inherently negative event — being targeted — into a source of intelligence, strategic advantage, and even economic value.

Deceptgold is ideal for cybersecurity teams, researchers, and critical infrastructure defenders who want more than just alerts. It is built for those who believe that every intrusion attempt is an opportunity — not just a threat.
