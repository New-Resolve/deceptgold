**Project Name:** Deceptgold  
**Executive Summary:**  
Deceptgold introduces a paradigm shift in cybersecurity: instead of treating attacks as mere threats, it turns them into measurable digital assets. By monetizing intrusion attempts through an innovative token-based model, Deceptgold creates a new revenue stream in a sector traditionally defined by cost. This breakthrough enables companies to generate value from vulnerability while gaining strategic intelligence. For investors, Deceptgold represents a high-impact opportunity at the intersection of security, blockchain, and data monetization — with scalable potential across industries that are under constant cyber pressure.

### 1. The Problem  
Companies suffer cyberattacks every day. These attacks consume CPU power, bandwidth, time, and attention – all wasted, with no return. The current scenario turns attacks into losses. Deceptgold has changed that.

### 2. The Solution  
Deceptgold transforms each attack attempt into digital tokens. These tokens are rewards automatically generated from requests made by attackers. The more attacks, the more tokens are generated — and the more resources the company has to invest in security, intelligence, and prevention.

### 3. How Deceptgold Works  
Distributed for Linux, Windows, and Apple, the honeypot captures attack data and converts it into tokens through smart contracts and code obfuscation. These tokens can be used to access Thread Intel, providing insights into malicious IPs, attacked services, and other threats. This makes the company smarter, anticipating risks and optimizing its defense actions.

### 4. Prevention of Unauthorized Farming  
To ensure that legitimate companies cannot farm their own tokens, techniques such as the intelligent rate limit were implemented. These techniques ensure that, regardless of the number of iterations performed, the system prevents the generation of invalid tokens, thus blocking malicious opportunists and maintaining the integrity and balance of the system.

### 5. Business Intelligence  
In addition to generating resources, Deceptgold provides Business Intelligence tools for strategic analysis of attacks. Users can use their own tokens to benefit from intelligent data features. With data on attack patterns and malicious behaviors, companies can make more informed decisions and always be ahead of threats.

### 6. Architecture and Security  
Deceptgold uses a robust architecture with code obfuscation and auditable smart contracts, ensuring security and transparency in the distribution of tokens. The tokenization of attack data is done with cutting-edge encryption, symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, providing a safe and efficient environment to protect your users.

### 7. The Future with Deceptgold  
Deceptgold redefines digital security, transforming attacks into financial resources and valuable data. With it, security stops being a cost and becomes an ongoing investment, strengthening defense, Business Intelligence and Trade Intelligence, and creating a virtuous cycle of growth and protection.
