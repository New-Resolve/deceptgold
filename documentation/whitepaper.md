**Abstract:**  

Deceptgold introduces a paradigm shift in cybersecurity: instead of treating attacks as mere threats, it turns them into measurable digital assets. By monetizing intrusion attempts through an innovative token-based model, Deceptgold creates a new revenue stream in a sector traditionally defined by cost. This breakthrough enables companies to generate value from vulnerability while gaining strategic intelligence. For investors, Deceptgold represents a high-impact opportunity at the intersection of security, blockchain, and data monetization — with scalable potential across industries that are under constant cyber pressure.

### 1. The Problem
Companies suffer cyberattacks every day. These attacks consume CPU power, bandwidth, time, and attention – all wasted, with no return. The current scenario turns attacks into losses. Deceptgold has changed that.

### 2. The Solution
Deceptgold transforms each attack attempt into digital tokens. These tokens are rewards automatically generated from requests made by attackers. The more attacks, the more tokens are generated — and the more resources the company has to invest in security, intelligence, and prevention. This new model not only makes attacks less damaging but also turns them into opportunities to finance better protection and analytics.

### 3. How Deceptgold Works
Distributed for Linux, Windows, and Apple, the honeypot captures attack data and converts it into tokens through smart contracts and code obfuscation. These tokens can be used to access Thread Intel, providing insights into malicious IPs, attacked services, and other threats. This makes the company smarter, anticipating risks and optimizing its defense actions. The deployment is modular and designed for easy integration into existing infrastructure. Deceptgold runs as a command-line binary, installable via system package managers (APT, DNF, Homebrew, etc.), making it lightweight, fast, and ideal for both cloud and on-premise environments.

### 4. Smart Contract Architecture
Deceptgold is built on the ERC-20 token standard and relies on a dual smart contract infrastructure. The first contract manages token issuance, while the second is responsible for validating digital signatures attached to each attack log. This structure ensures that each token is minted only after a cryptographically verifiable interaction, thus eliminating the possibility of self-farming or token inflation through spoofing.

### 5. Cryptographic Integrity
To authenticate and validate each threat interaction, Deceptgold uses Ethereum-compatible cryptographic signatures based on the Keccak-256 hashing algorithm. Each attack is serialized, signed, and submitted for on-chain verification, ensuring that only events with valid signatures — generated by trusted deceptgold — are eligible for token rewards. This system guarantees both transparency and immutability in token generation.

### 6. Granular Logging and User Control
Deceptgold provides granular attack logging, giving the honeypot operator full control over the data collected. Logs are detailed and structured to support strategic decisions, making threat analysis simple and actionable. It also allows the system customer to store or manage all attack data.

### 7. Use of Tokens for Advanced Resources
Tokens earned can be used to unlock deeper layers of intelligence, such as access to Thread Intel — offering behavioral scoring of IPs, the most targeted services, origin trends, and predictive threat mapping.

### 8. Prevention of Unauthorized Farming
To ensure that legitimate companies cannot farm their own tokens, intelligent rate-limiting mechanisms have been implemented. Combined with cryptographic verification and verification smart contracts, the system ensures that only external interactions, both real and malicious, are rewarded. This maintains the balance and trustworthiness of the ecosystem. Unlike traditional models where companies aim for fewer attacks, Deceptgold rewards visibility. In high-threat environments, Deceptgold provides a return on the very exposure that used to be purely negative. Even in periods of low attack frequency, the platform continues to offer value through access to analytics, threat mapping, and peer data contributions. Instead of merely reacting to threats, companies start earning while observing — and learning.

### 9. Business Intelligence
In addition to generating resources, Deceptgold provides Business Intelligence tools for strategic analysis of attacks. Users can use their own tokens to benefit from intelligent data features. With data on attack patterns and malicious behaviors, companies can make more informed decisions and always be ahead of threats.

### 10. Architecture and Security
Deceptgold uses a robust architecture with code obfuscation and auditable smart contracts, ensuring security and transparency in the distribution of tokens. The tokenization of attack data is done with cutting-edge encryption, using both symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic methods to protect communications, local data, and user identities.

### 11. The Future with Deceptgold
Deceptgold redefines digital security, transforming attacks into financial resources and valuable data. With it, security stops being a cost and becomes an ongoing investment, strengthening defense, Business Intelligence and Trade Intelligence, and creating a virtuous cycle of growth and protection.

### 12. Team and Trust
Deceptgold is being developed by a multidisciplinary team of cybersecurity professionals, blockchain developers, and data scientists, led by Jonathan Scheibel de Morais. The project is undergoing third-party security audits to validate its smart contracts and encryption mechanisms. Strategic partnerships with hosting providers, incident response teams, and academic institutions are underway to ensure broad applicability and resilience.
